common HTTP status codes:
404 Not Found
400 Bad Request
410 Gone
200 OK

The difference between a GET request and a POST request is that a GET request requires all the information for the page in the url bar and takes information from the server, while POST requests send information to the server, and cannot be bookmarked as most of the parameters are in the browser.

GET requests would be used when you dont need to be very secure with information, POST requests would be used when you would need to edit secure information, or enter it.
